`PathogenicityRanking` is an R package designed to compute and visualize composite pathogenicity scores
for missense variants based on tools like AlphaMissense, CADD, GERP++, REVEL, and more.

Use `run_pathogenicity_analysis()` to quickly analyze any variant annotation file and generate ranked output
with publication-ready plots and data exports.

For installation instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PathogenicityRanking).
